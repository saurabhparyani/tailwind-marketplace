### Buy a Product
* Buying a product is simple on Tailwind Marketplace. Simply click on a Product, then click on the Buy Product.
* You will be directed to a Stripe checkout page where you can enter the below test credentials:
* **Email**: Enter the **email address** that you **wish to receive the product in**. This is **important** because the product will be sent to this email only.
* **Card**: 4242 4242 4242 4242. **MM/YY**: 04/42. **CVV**: 424 [This are the test card details. Do not worry, you will not be paid]
* **Cardholder Name**: This does not matter what you put because Stripe is in test mode.

* When you click on Pay, you will be directed to a success page. Currently, the product bought is being sent to my personal email, and the functionality of sending the email to the user is a WIP.
* Similarly, if you click on the back button, you will be directed to a cancel page. 

### Sell a product
* Selling a product requires you to sign up as a user.
* Once signed up, you need to first **link your account to Stripe.** This takes you to the Stripe Connect dashboard. The following are the details you can put:
* **Email**: "Email is not needed in test mode". **Mobile Number**: You can click on "**the test phone number** which is US 0000000000.
* **Verification Code**: **000 000**
* **Country: United States** **Type of Business: Individual**. Click on Continue.
* **Legal first name, last name**: You can put your first and last names. Do not worry, since it's in dev mode, nothing really is a big deal. **Your website**: You can just add a **www.github.com**
* **Select an account for payouts**: **Test Institution**. Agree and Continue. Connect Accounts.
* **Save Account with Link**: It shows the email address you signed up with, and asks for a US number. Ignore the number and click on "**Not Now**". 
* **Select an account for payouts**: Shows a list of linked accounts. You can ignore them as they are all test banks. Click on Continue.
* **Review and Submit**: **Agree and Submit**
* Now you would get an "Account onboarded" followed by a success page saying "Linking was Successful"
* Click on your **nav-bar on the top right** and click on **Sell a Product** again.
* This gives you a complete Dashboard allowing you to sell a product.
* Once you create your product, you can see it on the homepage!
